            You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. There he
            comes. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe
            one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into
            the river and drowned. See there how easy that is. Pretend you're
            water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.

            If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Just
            let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Remember
            how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.
            We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. We don't
            have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it
            will. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build
            the framework first.

            Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they
            sort of just make themselves. Here we're limited by the time we
            have. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a
            chocolate brown. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and
            a touch of Prussian blue You're the greatest thing that has ever
            been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.
