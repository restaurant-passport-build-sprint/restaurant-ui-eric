# restaurant-ui-eric

This is Eric's repository for the Web UI portion of the Build Sprint Project: Restaurant Passport.

This website was built to direct people to an app that would help them overcome decision fatigue.
I built the website using LESS for the CSS.
I also added media queries at 1000px, 800px, and 500px.
I used images from unsplash.
I also created an About US page that included all the people that worked on the project.
I also created a SIGN UP button that would link the marketing page
